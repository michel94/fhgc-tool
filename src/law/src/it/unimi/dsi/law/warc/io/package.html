    <title>WARC I/O</title>
  </head>

  <body>

	<p>Provides classes performing low and high level WARC I/O (for format details, please see the <a href='http://archive-access.sourceforge.net/warc/warc_file_format-0.9.html'>ISO</a> draft).
	
	<p>This code is designed to be very efficient. In particular some choices are worth mentioning:
	
	<dl>
	
	<dt><strong>Object reuse</strong></dt>
	
	<dd>
	
	<p>Whenever possible, a single object must be used to perform multiple operations. 
	
	<p>For instance, to read a sequence of WARC records, one must instantiate a single {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.WarcRecord} object and invoke repeatedly its {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.WarcRecord#read(it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.io.FastBufferedInputStream bin) read} method, as opposed to have a new {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.WarcRecord} object for every record read.
	
	<p>The convenience iterators offered by {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.WarcFilteredIterator} and {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.HttpResponseFilteredIterator} follow this approach
	and need a {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.WarcRecord} to be given at construction time; such object will be reused by the iterator to expose the record read at every iteration.

	<dt><strong>Pull writes</strong></dt>
	
	<dd>
	
	<p>To write a record, one should provide a {@link it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.io.MeasurableInputStream} (by setting the {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.WarcRecord#block block} field of {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.WarcRecord}) from which the {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.WarcRecord#write(java.io.OutputStream out) write}
	method of {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.WarcRecord} will pull the data to be written.
	
	<p>This is especially convenient when the data comes from the network (as during a crawl) or from a read operation (as during batch processing of data) so that one can write a record simply using the available (suitably wrapped) input stream.

	<dt><strong>Public fields</strong></dt>
	
	<dd>
	
	<p>To avoid the overhead of getters and setters, some fields (such as the {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.WarcRecord#block block} and {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.WarcRecord#header header} of {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.WarcRecord} and 
	{@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.GZWarcRecord#gzheader gzheader} of 
	{@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.GZWarcRecord}) are declared <code>public</code>.
	
	</dl>
		
	<h3>Low level I/O</h3>
	
	<p>Low level I/O can be performed using {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.WarcRecord} for the WARC format or {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.GZWarcRecord} for the compressed WARC format. For further detail, see the class documentation. 
	
	<p>A very simple example of low level <em>sequential reads</em> can be found in the source code of {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.examples.SequentialWarcRecordRead}, while an example of low level <em>sequential writes</em> can be found in the source code of {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.examples.SequentialWarcRecordWrite}; both examples show how to use the plain and compressed WARC format.	
	
	<p>A (more complex) example of low level <em>random access reads</em> can be found in the source code of the {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.tool.CutWarc} tool (see also the {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.tool.IndexWarc} tool on how to create the index).
	
	<h3>High level I/O</h3>
	
	<p>High level I/O is provided at the moment only for (a subset of) the <code>response</code> record type of the WARC specification. More precisely, interfaces and classes are provided to deal with responses with <code>content-type</code> of <code>HTTP</code> (or <code>HTTPS</code>) kind. At the interface level, read-only access is mainly provided, in particular, all the interfaces specify getters for the various properties, but no getters. 
	
	<h4>Interfaces</h4>
	
	<p>More in detail, the {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.util.Response} interface (besides the abovementioned getters), prescribes the method {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.util.Response#fromWarcRecord fromWarcRecord} that allows to obtain a response from record. The {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.util.HttpResponse} specialises such interface to deal with responses having <code>content-type</code> of <code>HTTP</code> (or <code>HTTPS</code>) kind.
	
	<h4>Classes</h4>
	
	<p>The {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.util.AbstractHttpResponse} provides an abstract implementation of a {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.util.HttpResponse}
	with all the getters except for {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.util.HttpResponse#contentAsStream() contentAsStream} that concrete subclasses must implement according to the way they represent the response content; the {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.util.Response#fromWarcRecord(WarcRecord record) fromWarcRecord}) method is also left unimplemented much for the same reason. On the other hand, there is a {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.util.AbstractHttpResponse#toWarcRecord toWarcRecord} method that can be used by concrete subclasses to populate a WARC record with the data in the response (for example, in order to subsequently write such record).
	
	<p>The concrete class {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.util.WarcHttpResponse}, for instance, implements {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.util.HttpResponse#contentAsStream() contentAsStream} and {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.util.Response#fromWarcRecord(WarcRecord record) fromWarcRecord} methods so that the content is read from a WARC file and should indeed be used to read a {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.WarcRecord} (of suitable <code>record-type</code>) as an {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.util.HttpResponse}.
	
	<p>An example of the usage of such class to read a sequence of responses from a WARC file can be found in the source code of {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.examples.SequentialHttpResponseRead}.
		
	<p>Finally, the {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.util.MutableHttpResponse} is a concrete implementation of an {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.util.AbstractHttpResponse} endowed with setters that can be used to populate the response and hence a {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.WarcRecord} (via {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.util.AbstractHttpResponse#toWarcRecord(WarcRecord record) toWarcRecord} method) in order to write it.
		
	<!-- Once BUbiNG will become public, here we should also describe it.unimi.dsi.law.bubing.util.FetchedHttpResponse as an example of AbstractHttpResponse that implements contentAsStream passing the net stream, but does not implement fromWarcRecord for obvious reasons. -->
		
	<h3 id='dup'>Digest based duplicate detection</h3>
	
	<p>There are many ways to detect duplicates in a crawl. UbiCrawler adopts a technique based on page content digests. The interface {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.util.DigestBasedDuplicateDetection} is used to represent duplicate information present in WARC files produced by UbiCrawler.
	
	<!-- Once BUbiNG will become public, here we should describe the digesting process, with a see to it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.parser.Digester. -->
	
	<p>More precisely, the class {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.util.WarcHttpResponse} implements such interface so that after using it to read a WARC record, one can use the class {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.util.DigestBasedDuplicateDetection#isDuplicate() isDuplicate} method to know whether the response is a duplicate of a previously crawled one, and can use the {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.util.DigestBasedDuplicateDetection#digest() digest} method to get the digest of the response content.
	
	<!-- Once BUbiNG will become public, here we should also mention it.unimi.dsi.law.bubing.util.FetchedHttpResponse. -->
	
	<p>Observe that {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.util.AbstractHttpResponse} takes this interface into account and if the concrete class used to invoke 
	{@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.util.AbstractHttpResponse#toWarcRecord toWarcRecord} implements such interface, such method will populate the {@link it.unimi.dsi.law.warc.io.WarcRecord} with the duplicate information.
